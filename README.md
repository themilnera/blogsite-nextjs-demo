## Project Details

This is the setup for a simple blog site in Next.js, deployed on Netlify. The complete version will eventually have more complex features such as the ability to publish and read posted articles, as well as perhaps some social media features like comment sections. Right now, to meet project requirements, it's a simple CRUD for user created documents. Log in with an account and you can create, edit and delete your documents.
